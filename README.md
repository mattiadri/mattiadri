📚 I am a very **rational person**
who manages to combine the
technical knowledge acquired
at the university  with the
**classical studies** supported at
high school.

🙋🏻‍♀️ I really like **team
working** and I am a
constructive member of it. I
am very good at **managing the
conflicts** that often arise in
working in a group and I
frequently get the project to
proceed in the best way.

🎤 I like
to say **my opinion** and I
support it strongly but I’m
always ready to change my
mind if I’m wrong.

💾 I am
interested in the future **role of
data** and in the potential of **Ai**.
